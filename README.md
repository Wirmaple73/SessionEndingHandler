## Session Ending Handler
Are you tired and frustrated of shutting Windows down by accident and losing all of your important work, and possibly waiting an eternity for your PC to boot back up? Not anymore, Session Ending Handler is here to save the day!

This program works by intercepting and interrupting the system shutdown process which prevents the system from shutting down. It's also configured to start with Windows by default, not a single extra click needed. Run once and forget!

All you have to do is to simply minimize the program and let it run in the background, it'll automatically take care of the rest. Farewell, unwanted shutdowns!

## Notes
.NET 6 Desktop Runtime (either x86 or x64 depending on the .exe architecture you download) is required to run the program. You can download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0). (**Make sure to download the '.NET Desktop Runtime' version!**)
